# 100HoursProject
I am developing a Korean Language Learning Web App as part of my work with #100Devs. With this app, users can create a login to read and watch Korean stories and articles, complete grammar and vocabulary exercises, and save useful vocabulary to their vocab list.

# How It's Made
<strong>Tech used:</strong> Bootstrap, Materialize, Express, Mongoose/MongoDB

I used Bootstrap and Materialize for styling, and JavaScript for behavioral actions. For the backend of the application, I am using MongoDB, Express, Handlebars, and Node, with plans to add in React in the near future. 

# Optimizations
While I am still working on the base of this web app, there are already features and tools I would like to add in the future to help advance users' Korean language learning journey.
<ul>
  <li><strong>React:</strong> I am currently learning React and plan to incorperate it into this project to make it a complete MERN stack web application.</li>
  <li><strong>Journal Feature:</strong> Journal tool for users to practice writing in Korean using the grammar points and vocabulary from the app's learning materials.</li>
  <li><strong>Language Level Assessment:</strong> A brief but comprehensive test that users can take to assess their Korean language level. This will help users filter through the learning materials and study those that are ideal for their learning level.</li>
</ul>

# Lessons Learned:
This is my first fullstack web application. By committing 100 hours of work into this project, I am solidifying my understanding of the MERN stack. For this project, I learned Bootstrap and Materialize to create a professionally-styled look to the app. I originally learned EJS, but switched to Handlebars as I found that easier for me to understand and use. I've made smaller Node projects in the past, but this larger-scale web app has pushed me to really understand what is happening on the backend to create a multipage site with multiple features and ways for users to interact. I am especially enjoying learning how to connect and engage with my database on MongoDB with this project.
